## Build Instruction

* Each sample directory contains `build.bat` and `build.sh` file
* From the sample project directory, run `build.bat` in windows and `build.sh` in linux and mac
* The output will be generated in `bin` directory
* The default build process will build the sample in debug configuration i.e. no optimization
* For optimization build, you must specify `optimize` flag when running the build file, for example: `build.bat optimize` or `build.sh optimize`
