# Mandelbrot Set

## Definition
The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers c for which the function $f_c(z) = z^2 + c$ does not diverge when iterated from z = 0 ,remains bounded in absolute value.

For eg: $c = 1 + i$ belongs to the mandelbrot set if the final $f_c(z)$ does not reach infinity
  * $f_c(z) = c$
  * $f_c(z) = c^2 + c$
  * $f_c(z) = (c^2 + c)^2 + c$

And if the final result is inifinty then $c$ doesnâ€™t blong to Mandelbrot set.

## Here is the final result
