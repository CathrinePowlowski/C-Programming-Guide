## Some simple projects for you to try in no particular order:
- Snake game (C++ reference:  [youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lYLYlrGLg))
- Pong
- HTTP server
- Terminal file explorer
- Search anime from terminal
- Simple grep
- Online chatting via terminal
- Simple Turing machine
```
What this program (Turing Machine) basically has is: data which is the data memory, commands which is the code memory (these 2 are input from user), stack is temp memory (fixed size)
so one command is each one character: 
f -> move forward in data memomry
b -> move backward in data memory
a -> push the character from data memory to stack where cursor is present
d -> pop the character from stack
p -> display the character
+ -> add the 2 characters at top of stack and push the result to stack
- -> same as + but sub
well this is just example, this can be made into whatever fits
